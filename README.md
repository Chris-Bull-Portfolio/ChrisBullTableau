This is work I completed using Tableau in my Data Analysis Skills Bootcamp.

## Project 1 - Learning to create Visualisations
This project used the EMSI_JobChange_UK data: [EMSI_JobChange_UK.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18946582/EMSI_JobChange_UK.xlsx)

In this project, I did the following:
* Created a bar chart showing percentage change by indsutry, sorted highest to lowest
* Created a UK Map chart showing the percentage change by City
* Added both of these charts into a Dashboard
* Created an additional chart (for practice) comparing the number of jobs in each indsutry in the different years

The result of this dashboard and additional chart can be seen below:
